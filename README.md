# BOC Contract

BOC Contract is a smart contract project built on the Aptos blockchain. This project leverages Aptos Move to implement secure and efficient on-chain logic.

## Features

-   **Secure Transactions**: Ensures safe and transparent execution of transactions.
    
-   **Optimized for Performance**: Uses Moveâ€™s resource-oriented model to enhance efficiency.
    
-   **Decentralized Logic**: Implements decentralized smart contract operations.
    
-   **Extensibility**: Designed for future improvements and additional functionalities.
    

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Aptos CLI
    
-   Move CLI
    
-   Rust (for building dependencies)
    
-   Node.js (optional, for integration purposes)
    

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jeffreytrujillo1997418/boc-contract.git
    cd boc-contract
    ```
    
2.  Initialize Aptos and configure your account:
    
    ```
    aptos init
    ```
    
3.  Compile the Move contract:
    
    ```
    aptos move compile
    ```
    
4.  Deploy the contract to the Aptos blockchain:
    
    ```
    aptos move publish
    ```
    

## Usage

-   To interact with the contract, use the Aptos CLI:
    
    ```
    aptos move run --function <function_name>
    ```
    
-   Alternatively, integrate with a dApp using the Aptos SDK.
